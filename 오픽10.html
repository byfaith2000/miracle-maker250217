        I remember studying for a test when I was a kid.<br>
However, I think I ate something that went bad. I got food poisoning and it was pretty bad.<br>
I felt miserable because my stomach was upset. I could NOT do anything because the symptoms were quite severe.<br>
I got a stomachache and I felt like throwing up. I went to the bathroom over and over again because I had the runs.<br>
I had no choice but to go see the doctor. I got a shot and got some medicine prescribed.<br>
I came back home and took some medicine to get better. I had to take it easy for a few days and get a lot of rest.<br>
I could NOT study for the test because I was sick. Since then, I try to be more careful when I eat something.<br>
