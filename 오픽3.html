My favorite room<br>
<br>
My favorite room at home is my bedroom.<br> 
I like my room the most because it is the best place to get some rest.<br> 
<br>
I can kick back and relax when I get home. <br>
It is great to have my own private space.<br>
<br>
In my bedroom, I have a desk, a chair, a computer, a lamp and a clock. <br>
Plus, I have a bookshelf, a dressing table, a bed and a nightstand. <br>
Also, I have some dressers and some built-in closets.<br>
<br>
My favorite furniture in my room is my bed because I love to sleep. <br>
It has a very comfy and cozy mattress,<br>
Getting a good night's sleep is very important.<br>
<br>
I can do whatever I want to / in my room. <br>
I can get some sleep, study, surf the internet, watch TV or listen to music. <br>
I can also read books, watch movies or play games. <br>
<br>
So, this is what my room is like.
