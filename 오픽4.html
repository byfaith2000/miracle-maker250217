    <p style="font-size:150%">
    I remember living in a house when I was a kid. <br>
    There was a playground in front of my house. <br>
    I used to play there all the time with my friends. <br>
    We used to play in the sand or go on swings or slides. <br>
    I have many enjoyable memories of that place.<br>
    <br>
    But now, I live in a more spacious apartment. <br>
    There is a park nearby / where I can take walks or ride bikes. <br>
    I can get some exercise or get some fresh air there.<br>
    Plus, there are various types of stores and facilities near my home. <br>
    First, there is a post office, a police station, a fire station and a library nearby. <br>
    Also, there is a bus stop, a subway station, a train station and a taxi stand. <br>
    There is also a bank, a hair salon, a gym, a swimming pool and a dry cleaner's. <br>
    Next, there is a convenience store, a bakery, a drug store and a bookstore. <br>
    There are also some restaurants, coffee shops, fast food places and bars. <br>
    Plus, there are also some grocery stores, supermarkets and electronics stores. <br>
    So, this is what my neighborhood is like.<br>
