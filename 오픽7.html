        I remember when the TV broke down at home. <br>
It was very frustrating because I could NOT watch TV. <br>
I could NOT fix the problem myself, so I called up a person to fix it.<br>
<br>
Plus, I remember when the AC broke down at my place. <br>
It was during the summer and it was very hot without air-conditioning. <br>
Once again, I had to call up a person from the service center to fix it. <br>
<br>
Next, I remember when one of the light bulbs in the bathroom went out. <br>
So, I had to get a new bulb and replace the old one with the new one. <br>
<br>
What else? I remember when the remote control for the TV did NOT work well. <br>
So, I had to replace the batteries (베르뤼s) for the remote.<br>
<br>
Also, I remember when water leaked from the water cooler. <br>
There was water all over the place and it was a mess. <br>
I had to wipe off the water from the floor. <br>
<br>
Plus, I remember breaking a cup by accident. <br>
So, these were the problems I remember having at home.<br>
