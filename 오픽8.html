        As I mentioned, I remember breaking a cup at home.<br>
        I dropped the cup by mistake because it was slippery . I lost my grip. <br>
        <br>
        The cup broke into several pieces and I had to clean up the glass. <br>
        I picked up the big pieces and vacuumed the small pieces.<br>
        <br>
        I tried to be careful, but I cut my hand on a piece of glass.<br>
        It was bleeding and it was a little sore. <br>
        I cleaned the cut and put a bandaid on it.<br>
        <br>
        Since then, I try to be more careful.<br>
