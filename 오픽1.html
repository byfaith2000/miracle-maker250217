    My hometown<br>
    My neighborhood is Chimsan-dong in Buk-gu, Daegu. <br> 
    I have lived in this town for 6 years.<br>  Chimsan-dong is geographically very convenient. <br> 
    Close to Buk-gu IC and not far from downtown.<br>  
    Also, there is Kyungpook National University nearby, so whenever I have time, I go to Kyungpook National University to play.<br>  
    Kyungpook National University is one of the largest universities in Daegu.<br>  
    There is a large playground on campus, a small pond and plenty of shade from trees.<br> 
    Also, Shincheon flows near my house. <br> 
    There are well-developed bike paths and walking paths along Shincheon, where many people take a walk or exercise. <br> 
    I go to Shincheon to exercise 2-3 times a week.<br> 
    However, it is not good that there are no big mountains nearby.<br>  
    Daegu is a basin type, so there are no mountains in the city.<br>  
    So, to get to the mountain, it takes about 20-30 minutes by car. <br> 
    The nearby mountains are Palgongsan and Apsan. <br> 
    We mainly go to Palgongsan to play. <br> 
    From the base of Mt. Palgong to the top, it takes about 1 hour 30 minutes to 2 hours.<br>  
    In the past, I used to hike occasionally, but now I rarely do it. <br> 
    I want to climb Mt. Palgong soon.<br> 
    Living in a city seems to have its pros and cons.<br>  
    Transportation and shopping are convenient, but the air is not good and living in an apartment makes me miss a house with a garden. <br> 
    I also want to live in a house with fresh air and a yard someday.</p><br><br>
