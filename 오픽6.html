        I remember having a family gathering at home. <br>
        We invited some relatives over / for dinner.<br>
        <br>
        We cooked some food for the gathering,<br>
        but we also ordered in some food from a delivery restaurant. <br>
        <br>
        I helped set up the table before we ate. <br>
        The food tasted extra good because I was starving.<br>
        <br>
        After the gathering, I helped clean up. <br>
        There were some leftovers, so I put them in the fridge. <br>
        I also cleaned the table and did the dishes. <br>
        And then, I started to clean my apartment. <br>
        I opened all the windows to refresh the air. <br>
        I also vacuumed and mopped the floors and dusted the furniture. <br>
        Plus, I took out the trash and the recycling. <br>
        <br>
        Looking back, it was a very enjoyable gathering.<br>
