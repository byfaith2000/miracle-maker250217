        When I was a kid, my main responsibility was studying. <br>
I had to study day and night. <br>
There were so many subjects to study, especially in high school. <br>
<br>
I went to school early in the morning and came back home in the evening. <br>
I also went to cram schools after class. <br>
It was NOT easy to take extra classes until late at night.<br>
<br>
I also took some online courses for exams. <br>
I sometimes had to stay up all night to study for mid-terms and finals. <br>
I also got some private tutoring. <br>
My tutor was a college student and he helped me a lot with my studies. <br>
<br>
In high school, I especially did NOT have much free time in my senior year. <br>
I was very busy applying for college.<br>
Once again, my main responsibility was studying when I was a kid.<br>
