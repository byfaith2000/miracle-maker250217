        Frankly speaking, my parents and I do NOT solve problems at home differently. <br>
        First, we deal with small problems ourselves.  <br>
        For example, I remember breaking a glass at home.  <br>
        The glass broke into several pieces and I had to clean up the glass.  <br>
        I picked up the big pieces and vacuumed the small pieces.  <br>
        Next, I remember when one of the light bulbs in the bathroom went out.  <br>
        So, I had to get a new bulb, and replace the old one with the new one.  <br>
        What else? I remember when the clock in the living room did NOT work well.  <br>
        So, I had to replace the batteries for the clock. <br>
        On the other hand, when there are bigger problems at home, we get help from professionals.  <br>
        For instance, I remember when the washer broke down at my place.  <br>
        It was frustrating because I could NOT do the laundry.  <br>
        We could NOT fix the problem myself, so we called up a person to fix it. <br>
        Once again, we do NOT solve problems at home THAT differently. <br>
