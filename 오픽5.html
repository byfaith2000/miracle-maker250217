        I remember renovating my apartment a few years ago. <br>
        I redid the wallpaper and the windows. <br>
        I also redid the floors, the curtains and the blinds.<br> 
        I also redid the bathroom, the kitchen and the living room.<br>
        <br>
        After the renovation, my home looked brand new. <br>
        I was very happy with the new look. <br>
        It was worth the money I spent.<br>
        <br>
        Plus, I remember getting some new furniture for my apartment.<br>
        I got a new sofa, a new tea table and some new dressers. <br>
        I also got a new bed, a new bookshelf and a new chair. <br>
        Sometimes, I rearranged the furniture for a change.<br>
        <br>
        Also, I got some plants and pictures for the apartment. 
        Plus, I got a new television and a new air-conditioner for the living room. <br>
        Next, I took a family picture and put it up on the wall. <br>
        <br>
        So, these were the changes I remember.<br>
